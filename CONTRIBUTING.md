OpenSuspect is a community-developed game, and contributions are both welcome and appreciated.
In order to maximize the chance your contribution will be accepted, we've provided some guidelines to assist you.
Depending on what area of the game you'd like to help with, the guidelines are different.
The requirements of the programming team are very different than that of the art team for example!

## Programming
1. Find the issue that coroponds to the work you'd like to do
2. Comment on the issue saying that you're going to try implementing it
3. If you're part of the Programming Team on GitHub, assign the issue to yourself
4. If possible, link in the issue to the branch / location where the work will take place (this is optional, and should be skipped for smaller tasks)
5. Include the rough time you think the implementation will take (just a ballpark is fine! are we talking hours, days, weeks?)
6. Once you think you've met the requirements to close the issue, [submit a new Pull Request](https://github.com/opensuspect/opensuspect/compare)
7. Wait for a review
8. If the review is successfull, **merge**! Congratulations and thank you for contributing!
9. If any issues are identified, correct them and return to step 7.

Please join us in the [OpenSuspect programming chatroom](https://matrix.to/#/#open_sus_programming:matrix.org) if you have any questions, get stuck, or just to hang out and talk about the project.
